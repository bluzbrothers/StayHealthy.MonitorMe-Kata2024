# ADR-004: Data Retention Policy - 24-Hour Data Expiry
## Date:
2024-02-17

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
In the context of our project, managing data storage efficiently while adhering to privacy regulations and system performance requirements is crucial. The volume of data generated and collected by our system, particularly time-series data, necessitates a clear data retention policy to balance between data availability, compliance, and resource optimization.

## Decision:
We have decided to implement a data retention policy within our database that mandates the deletion of data after a 24-hour period. This decision is grounded in the following justifications:

Compliance and Privacy: Adhering to privacy laws and regulations that require the minimization of personal data storage duration.
System Performance: Maintaining optimal system performance by preventing excessive data accumulation, which can lead to longer query times and increased storage costs.
Cost Efficiency: Reducing storage costs associated with retaining large volumes of data over time.
## Consequences:
### PROS:
- Ensures compliance with data protection regulations by limiting the duration of personal data storage.
- Maintains high system performance by regularly purging outdated data, thereby reducing the load on storage and processing resources.
- Optimizes costs by minimizing the required storage capacity and associated expenses.
### CONS:
- Risk of losing potentially valuable data that could contribute to future analysis or insights if the retention period is too short.
- Possible challenges in cases where data needs to be retained longer for audit purposes or to meet other regulatory requirements.
- The need for a robust backup and archiving strategy for essential data that must be preserved beyond the 24-hour retention period.
