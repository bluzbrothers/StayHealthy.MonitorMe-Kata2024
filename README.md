MonitorMe is an advanced medical patient monitoring system created by StayHealthy, Inc. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, the demand for sophisticated monitoring solutions becomes increasingly important. MonitorMe meets this demand by providing a comprehensive platform that continuously monitors patients' vital signs, analyzes data for potential issues, and notifies medical professionals when necessary. This architectural narrative offers a detailed exploration of MonitorMe's system architecture, emphasizing its main components, data flow, communication methods, and adherence to non-functional requirements. By understanding MonitorMe's architecture, stakeholders and the development team can gain insight into how the system functions, its alignment with business objectives, and its potential to improve patient care in healthcare environments. Let's explore the architectural complexities of MonitorMe to reveal its innovative design and capabilities.


## *MonitorMe* requirements
Upon receiving the [requirements](Business/Requirements.md) from the stakeholders, our team proceeded to analyze and distill the information provided. This involved a thorough examination and refinement process to extract the essential elements and key details. 
By conducting this requirements distillation, we aimed to ensure a clear understanding of the project scope and objectives, enabling us to proceed with the development process effectively and efficiently. 
We came up with the [business overview](Business/Overview.md) and  [distilled requirements](Business/DistilledRequirements.md). Frankly speaking, all these requirements can be covered by the four main data flows:
* Collecting data from sensors and visualizing them on the nurse's station.
* Alerting the medical staff on both mobile devices and the nurse's station when anomalies are detected based on defined and easily extendable rules.
* Browsing the patient's vital signs (maximum 24 hours).
* Sending the snapshot to *MyMedicalData.*


## Exploring components
We conducted *Event Storming* technique to identify main components for the MonitorMe system. 
This collaborative workshop helped us visualize system workflows, identify domain events, and determine the interactions between components. 
Through this process, we [identified the necessary components and their relationships](EventStorming/EventStorming.md), informing the design and implementation of the system.
Here are the results:

## Identifying architecture characteristics
The [Business Requirements](Business/DistilledRequirements.md) and [Event Storming](EventStorming/EventStorming.md) results have led us to delve deeper into the project and [identify crucial architectural characteristics](ArchitectureCharacteristics/Characteristics.md) that are highly important for the Monitor Me system.

Choosing the right architectural characteristics is a critical process that lays the foundation for designing an effective architecture and defining efficient data flow within a system. By carefully considering these characteristics, one can determine the most suitable software and hardware components to effectively fulfill the system requirements. This ensures not only the proper functioning of the system but also its scalability, maintainability, and overall performance.
Based on the requirements and our expertise, the following top three characteristics have been identified:

## Choosing the architecture
Having identified the top three driving characteristics, we can simply choose the architecture style that best fits our business case [ADR-012](/ADR/ADR-012-event-driven-architecture.md)

## Designing the architecture
By utilizing the C4 approach, specifically focusing on the Context (C1) and Container (C2) views, we can effectively visualize the overall structure and key dependencies within the MonitorMe system. 

### Context view (C1)
The Context view allows us to understand the high-level relationships and interactions between the system and its external components or systems. 
All architectural decisions are documented as the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

<img src="C4/images/c1.jpg" />

The whole description of the Context view can be found [here](/C4/C1-context.md).

### Container view (C2)
Meanwhile, the Container view provides a detailed breakdown of the internal components and how they are organized within containers such as services, databases, and user interfaces. 
This approach enables us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system architecture, facilitating effective communication and decision-making throughout the development process.

The picture below show the final Container (C2) view.

The whole description of the Context view can be found [here](/C4/C2-containers.md).

### Important use cases visualized on sequence diagrams
There were identified four main system use cases:
* [Monitoring patients by nurse stations](UseCases/US1-monitor.md)
* [Alerting when anomalies detected](UseCases/US2-alert.md)
* [Taking a snapshot from the nurse station](UseCases/US3-snapshot.md)
* [Reviewing historical data from the nurse station](UseCases/US4-review-data.md)

## Thinking about deployment
The final deployment diagram looks like the diagram below. If you want to see details, go to the [Deployment section](Deployment/Deployment.md).

## Fitness functions
| Function                                                 | Goal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Characteristic to test        | Result      |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| [Infrastructure validation](FitnessFunctions/Sizing.md)  | The goal is to check whether business goal to achieve an average response time<br/>of 1 second or less for displaying vital signs.                                                                                                  | Performance                   | **Success** |
| [Guarantee to receive alert](FitnessFunctions/Alerts.md) | Medical professionals receive alert push notifications of a potential problem based on raw data analysis <br/>to a StayHeathy mobile app on their smart phone as well as the consolidated monitoring screen in each nurses station. | Availability                  | **Success** |
| [Fail-over](FitnessFunctions/Failover.md)                | If any of vital sign device (or software) fails, MonitorMe must still function for other vital sign monitoring (monitor, record, analyze, and alert).                                                                               | Availability, Fault Tolerance | **Success** |

## Postponed decisions or well-known issues

 | Functionality                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
 |----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Authentication and Authorization       | The whole authentication and authorization should be considered, however it is a known issue that could be solved on both ways:<br/> - as a part of MonitorMe system<br /> - as the SSO of the current solution in hospital                                                                                      |
 | Push notifications to the mobile phone | Push notifications are a standard solution for delivering real-time alerts to users' devices. However, their implementation falls outside the scope of the current architecture proposal, which focuses on defining system components. Integrating push notification functionality will be addressed separately. |
 | VPN to the external systems            | To decide in further steps whether establishing VPN for access to the MedicalData is worth considering for enhanced security and privacy. On this stage, it doesn't play significant role and this decision can be taken later.                                                                                  |
 | The hardware                           | Computers, servers, display screens should follow the newest commercial standards and parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
 | Patient registration                   | The next iteration should show how to register  patients, assign sensors to them and map Patients to the MyMedicalData                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Integration with MonitorThem           | The integration with MonitorThem is not specified by stakeholders. The next step should clarify the point of integration, but it shouldn't change the architecture at all                                                                                                                                        |
